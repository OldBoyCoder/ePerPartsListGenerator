# Release 20 database structure 

Release 20 is the version currently in use on the [Fiat Forum](https://www.fiatforum.com/)

It dates from 2004?  and so only contains information up to that date.


## Images

Images are, mostly, held in `NA` files which hold multiple images.  I've written a utility to extract the image files
from `NA` files, the source and documentation can be found here https://github.com/OldBoyCoder/ePerNAFileDump
